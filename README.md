# OpenIddict, as an OpenID Connect Addict

### What's Open Iddict ?

OpenIddict library aims to provide a simple and easy out of the box solution to implement your OpenID Connect 
server for ASP.NET 5.
OpenIddict leverages the use of Identity (for user management) and Entityframework (as store provider).

### What's Open ID Connect ?

Open ID is a protocol that allows multiple clients to delegate the Authentication to one or multiple Authority servers.
Facebook, Google, Twitter, are all well-known as OpenId Authority Servers.

### Why should I want/need my own Open ID Connect Server?

There are many scenarios on when this may be useful, 

 1. Having multiple applications with one central place for authentication.
 2. Having non-trusted clients (like JavaScript, Desktop or Mobile applications).
 3. Needs or wants to use single sign-on for multiple services.

In general terms, you want to have a centralized authentication server/login and then any allowed clients
(yours or not) can use the authentication server to handle identity and claims.

--------------

## Getting Started

To use OpenIddict Server you need to include OpenIddict as a dependency in your project.json:
```
    "dependencies": {
        "OpenIddict": "1.0.0-*"
    },
```

In ConfigureServices there's a handy extension method for IdentityBuilder that you need to set up.
Here is a complete ConfigureServices including Identity, Mvc and EntityFramework:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    services.AddMvc();

    services.AddEntityFramework()
        .AddSqlServer()
        .AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(Configuration["Data:DefaultConnection:ConnectionString"]));

    services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
        .AddDefaultTokenProviders()
        .AddOpenIddict();

    /// .... other services you may have
}

in your Configure method, you will need to use it:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app) {
    app.UseIdentity();
    
    // any external provider like, app.UseGoogleAuthentication, app.UseFacebookAuthentication, etc..
    
    app.UseOpenIddict(options => {
        // options
    });
}
```

> `UseOpenIddict()` must be **AFTER** `app.UseIdentity()` and any external providers.

### Configuration & Options.

<p>OpenIddict have multiple options you can set to customize for your requirements/needs.<p>
